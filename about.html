  <h1>About</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Nathan Bush &bull; AI Filmmaker &bull; AI Director &bull; Video Editor &bull; Motion Designer</p>
</section>

<section class="about-content">
  <p>Nathan Bush is an AI filmmaker and commercial video producer with more than fifteen years of experience in New York advertising and media production. Since arriving in New York in 2010, he has worked across nearly every discipline in post-production -- video editing, motion graphics, 3D animation, color grading, sound design, and cinematography -- building a versatile skill set that now gives him a distinct advantage in the rapidly evolving world of generative AI video.</p>

  <p>Over the course of his career, Nathan has collaborated with some of the biggest names in advertising. He has cut spots and brand films for Coca-Cola, Google, Budweiser, Tiffany & Co., Meta, NASA, Morgan Stanley, and dozens of other global brands, working through agencies including Ogilvy, Anomaly, BBH, Grey, and Huge. His time in both New York and Los Angeles advertising communities gave him deep fluency in the creative workflows, client expectations, and production standards that define broadcast-quality commercial video production.</p>

  <p>In 2024, Nathan pivoted fully into AI filmmaking. Recognizing that generative AI was about to reshape the industry, he began developing end-to-end AI production pipelines that combine tools like MidJourney, Kling, and Veo with traditional post-production software -- Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Blender. The result is a process that delivers polished, broadcast-ready content without the overhead of traditional shoots: no crews, no locations, no weather delays. Just concept to delivery.</p>

  <p>What sets Nathan apart from other practitioners in AI video production is his foundation in real-world craft. He is not learning filmmaking through AI; he is applying fifteen years of editorial instinct, compositional knowledge, and storytelling discipline to a new set of tools. Every frame is graded, every cut is intentional, and every sound is designed -- the same standards he held on set and in the edit suite now carry through his AI-driven work.</p>

  <p>As an AI director and filmmaker, Nathan brings a rare combination of technical depth and creative instinct to generative video. He directs AI-produced commercials with the same shot-by-shot intentionality he brought to live-action sets -- controlling composition, pacing, color, and performance at every stage of the pipeline.</p>

  <p>Nathan is based in New York City and available for remote collaboration worldwide. He regularly works with agencies and brands in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta, Nashville, and London. Whether a project calls for a full AI-produced brand film, motion graphics for a product launch, 3D animation for an explainer, or a hybrid approach that blends AI-generated footage with live-action material, he brings the same level of precision and creative ambition to every engagement.</p>
